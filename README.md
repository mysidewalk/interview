Interview Questions
===================

For each of the languages in this project (js and python), there are 6 questions. Each of these
questions typically requires that you fill in code to fulfill the condition set forward in comments
above the question. When necessary, use commented lines to provide additional information in your
answer.
There is also one html/css question comprised of a design to be implemented and one data 
visualization problem comprised of a set of data to be visualized.

Download or clone the repository locally, complete as many questions as you are able, compress the
directories containing your answers, and email your submission to **matt at mysidewalk dot com and
careers at mysidewalk dot com**.

Please do not fork, post a pull request, or in any other way publicly expose your answers. This is
further covered in the license included with this repository.

Any vagueness in the questions or difficulty that you encounter reproducing the source locally
and getting it to run is a useful and intentional part of the evaluation, as such, while feedback is
always appreciated, candidates experiencing difficulty should attempt to work through the challenge using
the resources they would use to navigate any other individual challenge rather than sending us a request
for assistance.
